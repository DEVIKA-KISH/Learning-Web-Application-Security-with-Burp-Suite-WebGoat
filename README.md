# Learning Web Application Security with Burp Suite & WebGoat

### 🎯 Objective
This project demonstrates **web-application penetration testing** using **OWASP WebGoat** and **Burp Suite**.  
WebGoat is a deliberately insecure application for learning and practicing OWASP Top-10 vulnerabilities.  
Burp Suite acts as an **intercepting proxy**, enabling inspection, modification, and replay of HTTP traffic between client and server.

## 🧰 Tools & Environment

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **WebGoat (OWASP)** | Vulnerable training web application |
| **Burp Suite Community Edition** | Web proxy and vulnerability testing framework |
| **Docker Desktop / Kali Linux** | Containerized deployment and analysis environment |
| **Browser (Chromium / Firefox)** | Used to interact with the application via localhost |

---

## ⚙️ Step 1 – Setting Up WebGoat via Docker

```bash
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 webgoat/webgoat
````

This pulls and runs the latest WebGoat image locally on ports 8080 (WebGoat) and 9090 (WebWolf).

Once the container starts, the terminal displays the Spring Boot startup log and the WebGoat ASCII banner.

## 🌐 Step 2 – Accessing WebGoat Application

Open the browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080/WebGoat
```

Login using default credentials:

* **Username:** admin
* **Password:** admin

## 🔍 Step 3 – Configuring Burp Suite Proxy

1. Launch **Burp Suite**.
2. Set the browser proxy to `127.0.0.1:8080`.
3. Enable **Intercept On** to capture requests between browser and server.

This allows Burp Suite to intercept, analyze, and manipulate HTTP traffic in real time.

---

## 🧾 Step 4 – Inspecting HTTP Requests

After intercepting traffic, the request details appear under **Proxy → HTTP History**.

* The browser sent a GET request to `/WebGoat/login`.
* Burp Suite displayed HTTP headers such as User-Agent, Accept-Language, and Cookie.
* This visibility helps test for authentication and session handling flaws.

## 🧪 Step 5 – Login Attempt and POST Interception

* An invalid login was attempted to generate a **POST** request.
* Burp Suite captured the form data (username & password) before it reached the server.
* Parameters could then be modified to simulate attacks such as SQL Injection or Credential Brute Force.

## 🧩 Findings & Insights

| Test                     | Observation                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **GET Request Analysis** | Revealed endpoint structure (`/WebGoat/login`) and header information          |
| **POST Interception**    | Captured credentials and demonstrated modification capability                  |
| **Proxy Inspection**     | Verified client-server communication for authentication process                |
| **Learning Outcome**     | Understood how Burp Suite acts as a man-in-the-middle tool for ethical testing |

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Input Validation & Sanitization** – Prevent SQL Injection and XSS.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication** – Add secondary verification for login pages.
3. **Secure Session Management** – Protect against session fixation and hijacking.
4. **Regular Penetration Testing** – Audit applications periodically for emerging vulnerabilities.

---

## 🧠 Summary

This lab provided hands-on experience in ethical hacking and web-security assessment using Burp Suite and WebGoat.
You learned how to:

* Intercept and modify HTTP requests.
* Analyze traffic flows in real time.
* Identify authentication and input validation flaws.
* Apply defensive recommendations for secure web development.

WebGoat served as a controlled training platform, while Burp Suite provided a powerful toolset for dynamic application testing and analysis.
